          All technical preparations have been successfully done to send the country's first communications satellite Bangabandhu-1 to its orbit on May 10, 2018 US local time or May 11 Bangladesh standard time if weather favours.

“We have received positive responses from the launching company Space Exploration Technologies Corporation [SpaceX] today [yesterday] and the countdown has started for Bangladesh to enter the satellite club,” Shahjahan Mahmood, chairman of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), told The Daily Star.

Weather is always a challenge for launching satellites and without it there are no other issues left before Bangabandhu-1 is put into its orbital slot on 119.1 degrees east, Mahmood added.

“We are about to enter a new era and all 16 crore people are eagerly waiting to be a part of that glory,” he observed.

The country's first geostationary communications satellite would be launched by Falcon 9 rocket, which has also been found okay to carry the satellite from Cape Canaveral launching pad of Florida, USA.
